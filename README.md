# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Dashboard

This project simulates a full analytics pipeline to analyze customer churn behavior using OLAP-style exploration, predictive modeling with PyTorch, and an interactive Tableau dashboard.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

The goal is to identify factors contributing to customer churn in a telecom company and provide business-friendly insights using both statistical analysis and machine learning. The project demonstrates:

- Data cleaning and warehouse-style dimensional modeling
- OLAP exploration (churn rates by contract, internet service, tenure, etc.)
- Predictive churn classification using a neural network (PyTorch)
- Key KPIs and trends visualized using Tableau
